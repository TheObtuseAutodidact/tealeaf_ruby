For example, write out pseudo-code (both casual and formal) that does the following:

1. a method that returns the sum of two integers
2. a method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together
3. a method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element
No need to code here, just practice writing logic out in English.

1.
GET ints A and B
return A + B

2.
GET array_of_strings
SET a variable to an empty string
iterate through array concat'ing each string item to the variable string
return variable

3.
GET array_of_ints
iterate through array_of_ints, collecting into a new array, odd(or even) indexed array items
return new array
